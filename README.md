# Vue Img Mapper extension

This repository is is a small extension to [vue-img-mapper](https://github.com/img-mapper/vue-img-mapper), containing ids in the rendered image areas and a target attribute.

The target attribute allows to open a link in a new window or tab if the user clicks on a highlighted area.
